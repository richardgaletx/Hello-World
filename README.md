# Hello-World
Introductory exercise
Hmmmm....well, we've had several students do tutorials on git, github, etc., and now, it looks like I'm going to go through the exercise. Mostly due to trying to get the Lightcrafter development engine running with the Beaglebone Black. And like that...
Ah..I think the next thing I might do is get the robotics cape for the BBB and think about how I might use that for Oraacle.
